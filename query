1.Number
columnname datatype (size)
ex:
rollno number size ....you can give or not bydefaul it will take 
2.character datatype is a fixed length  (it can contain alpha numeric value)
ex:
sname char (10)
varchar2   it will also contain both alpha numeric and numeric values
3.date datatype
columnname datatype(size)

how to create table ?
create table tablename.

create table student
(
columnname number,
columnname varchar2 (10)
);
create table student
(
srn number,
sname varchar2(10)
);

DDL// data defination language
it works on the structure of a table. it will create column.
\\
create table tablename 
(
columnname datatype size,
columnname datatype size
);

describe student;
desc student;

alter
add,modify,drop,rename
alter table tablename
add
(
columnname datatype size,
columnname datatype size
);

for single column bracet is not mandatory ,for best practices we use bracet


alter table student
add
(
sph number,
sadd varchar2 (10)
);
desc student;
describe student;


alter table student
modify
(
sname varchar2 (50),
srn number
);
desc student;
describe student;
we cannot modify columnname, we can modify datatype,size.
drop 
alter table tablename
drop column columnname;
drop (column1,clumn2);


alter table student
drop column srn;
desc student;


Rename
it is used to rename a particular column

alter table tablename
rename column oldcolumnname to newcolumnname;

alter table student rename column sname to fname;


--------------------------------------------------------------------


previously we drop the column,


drop table tablename;


drop table student;

desc student;


How to recover a table after a drop?
flashback table tablename to before drop;

flashback table salary to before drop;

 drop table tablename purge;
 
 rename oldtablename to newtablename
 
 rename student to student123;
 
 
 desc student123;
 
 trucate
it will delete all the record of a table.
suppose if table having 1 lakh rows it will delete all rows.

 copy table content from existing table. 
create table tablename as select * from oldtablename;

if you want to copy only stucture then you need to give any false condition;


select * from tab;
select * from job_history;

create table job1_history as select * from  job_history;
select * from job1_history;


create table job1_history as select * from  job_history where 1=2;

-------------------------------------------

DML
data manupulation language

create table student (sname varchar2(10),sno number);
insert into tablename values ('tanmay',1200);
address method
insert into tablename values('&sname',&sno)

insert into tablename(sname) values('tanmay');

blank value--- 

what is a null value
null is a undefined and unassigned value
any arithmetic operation with null value is null value and one null value is not equal to another null value/


update --- it will update some record into existing table.

update tablename set columnname=values;  it will change all record to values.


update tablename set columnname1=values where columnname2 =value;

where clause is used to restrict the data;


truncate delete all the records at time but 

________________________________

select columnname from tablename where condition group by expression having condition order by asc/desc;

set linesize 200;
set pagesize 200;

select * from emp;

select job,ename from emp;

operator
arithmetic operation possible only on number data types

 i want to display employee name,job,salary?
 
select ename,job,sal from emp;

 select ename,job,sal,sal *100 from emp;
 
 waq to give 10% bonus to each employee?
 arithmetic operation works on number data types
 
 select sal, comm , sal +comm from emp from emp;
 
 any arithmetic operation with null value will reamin null.
 
 
select sal, comm , sal +comm as bonus from emp from emp;

this is known as column alias , it is a short name given to a column, its valid only for current session only .

select sal,comm, sal+comm "annual bonus" from emp;

relational operator
-------------------
disp all the emp no and their name whose sal grater than 3000?
select ename,job from emp where sal>3000;
 
 select ename,job from emp where sal>=5000;

disp all the emp no and their name whose sal not equal to 3000?
select ename,job from emp where sal<>5000;

what is the use of where clause?
where we are using to  restrict the rows. e.g in emp table if we do select * from emp itw ill
give you all the rows incase we want emp details with condition where cluse will restrict and give o/p.

select * from emp1 where job = 'MANAGER' and sal >2000;
and will check all the condition then result is true.

select * from emp1 where job = 'MANAGER' and sal >2000 and deptno = 20;

select * from emp1 where job = 'MANAGER' or sal>2000 or deptno=20;
any condition true ans will come.
select * from emp1 where sal>=2000 and sal <=5000;

select * from emp1 where sal between 2000 and 5000;

emp details who are not getting commision?
select *from emp1 where comm = null;
null cannot be operated with any arithmetic operation

select * from emp1 where comm is null;

select * from emp1 where comm is not null;


select * from emp1 where deptno in(10,20);

it works faster than or and operator

select * from emp1 where deptno not in(10,20);
employee name start with A
select * from emp1 where ename like 'A%';
select * from emp1 where ename like '%T';
select * from emp1 where ename like '%AL%';

select * from emp1 where ename like '_%L';

select * from emp1 where ename like '__L%';
select * from emp1 where ename like '_%LL';

_______________________________________________
------------------------------------------------

Group BY 

function 

select min(sal) from emp;
select max(sal) from emp;

select avg(sal) from emp;

select sum(sal) from emp;
select count(*) from emp;

select count(comm) from emp;

group by it arragnge similar data type inti groups
select count(ename), job from emp group by job;


select max(sal),job from emp group by job;

having clause

disp job wise max sal but max sal must be greater tha 2500?


incase of where clause you cannot use max or group function.

if you are using all clause it should be arrange in sytematic order.
where clause we are restricting rows
having clause we are using to restricting groups from groups of data.

select * from emp order by sal;
it will sort the sal column
select * from emp order by sal desc;

select * from emp order by comm;

 



--------------------------

constrains we use to limit the type of data which will go intio the table.

Not null, unique, foreign, check constrant
create table book(bprice number not null);

column level and table level
when we define in column while creating table .

 insert into tablename values(&sno);
unique contraint -- not allowed duplicate value inti the table

create table chair (cprice number unique);
insert into tablename values(&cprice);

insert null twice
it will inserted becuase null values are not equal


craete table house(
hprice number,
hno number ,
hadd number
,
unique(hprice,hno));
table label declaration


enter 100 242 767
100 243 676

it will take in pair , if unique constraint is applied on more than one comuln then is composite

uniq and not null combination is known as primary constraint.
in a table only one primarykey possible.

 create table stud(sroll number primarykey);
 
 if we create more than one primary key in table then its known as composite primary key.
 
 max 32 column you can declare composite key.
 
 
 
--------------------------------------

forign key is required to establish connection between two tables.

foreign key can conatin duplicate value , its also known as referential integrety constraint.

master and slave concept , mater table have primary constraint



craete table home(hid number primary key);  master table
we will craete foreign column in another table.

primary key table and foreign column data type must be same.

create table home1(hno number references home (hid));
insert into home values(&hid);
{12 20 40 50 60}
insert into home1 values(&hno);
{30} 
o/p integrity constraint violated

it will take duplicate values also

select * from home ;
select * from home1;

delete from home where hid= 50;
you cannot delete record directly from primary table , you need to delete
the child record first.
delete from home1 where hno = 20;


to avoid such scenerios oracle introduce on delete cascade and set null conscept.


create table bus(bno numbaer primary key)

create table bus1(bno  numbaer primary key)


create table bus2(bid number references bus1(bno) on delete cascade);


select * from bus1,bus2;
delete from bus1 where bno=10;


select * from bus2;
on delete cascade
if we delete record from primary key table then FK table record automatically delete
set null
if we delete record from primary key table then FK table record automatically set to null;

table lable syntax
craete table car1( cid number , cm number, foreign key (cm) references car (cno));

check constrains
it is used to satisfy the business rule

create table person (pid number, pa number check(pa>20));

insert into person values(&pid,&pa);

create table van(vno number constraint xyz not null);
how to know which constraint declare on a table?

every thing in pracle is object 

select * from tab;
it will show all the table in oracle;
describe user_constraints;
select owner,constraint_name,constraint_type from user_constraintswhere table_name ='BUS1';
 
select owner,constraint_name,constraint_type from user_constraintswhere table_name ='sahu';
desc user_cons_columns;

select * from user_cons_columns where table_name='van';

desc van;
alter table van add (vid numbaer not null);

if we want to add constrains to existing table its possible but clumn should be empty;

alter table van2 add primary key (vid));


-------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------

TCL

transaction control language
commit 
roll back
savepoint


after every dml operation we need to commit it;
ddl transaction is auto commit

create table trusck(tno number,tid numbaer);

insert into truck values(&tno,&tid);


commit;

it will save the transaction
insert into truck values(&tno,&tid);
select*from tablename;
rollback ;
select * from table;
because we didnot commit it became rollback i.e uno the transaction


suppose we have created 100 record if we execute roll back 
it will be lost.to avoid this we use save point.

insert into truck values(&tno,&tid);
insert into truck values(&tno,&tid);

savepoint s1;
insert into truck values(&tno,&tid);
insert into truck values(&tno,&tid);
savepoint s2;

select * from truck;

rollback to savepoint s1;
select * from truck;

what is diff b/w delete and trucate?

trucateis ddl and delete is dml;
delete will delet row by row and can delete all recode but
inacse of truncste it will delet all recods.
incase of truncate roll bace is not possible but inacse of delet its possible.
roll bacl possible in delet menas it have an recycle bin which is not possible in tuncate
hence truncate is faster than delete command.


drop and delete
drop deletes the structure and delete don't.

-------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------

Join

select * from emp;
select * from dept;

display
empname,job,depto no from tabel

to join table n-1 condition required.

there should be a common column in the table we are joining.


equi join or inner join.

it will return all the rows from the multiple table.


select columns from table1 inner join table2 on table1.common columnname= table2. common columnname


select ename ,job,dname from emp inner join dept on emp.deptno=dept.deptno;

equi join is also known as inner join.

select ename ,job,dname,deptno from emp inner join dept on emp.deptno=dept.deptno;
it will o/p column ambiguiosly defined

when column name occurs in more than one column then it gives error.
we use alias name


select e.ename,e.job,e.dname,d.deptno from emp e inner join dept d on e.deptno=d.deptno;

select e.ename,e.job,e.dname,d.deptno from emp e , dept d where e.deptno=d.deptno;

select * from dept;
inner join/equi join always provide the matching rows from both the table
it will not dips deptno 40 

outer join

left outer join and right outer join

left outer will disp all records from left side table but only matching record from table 2.
select e.ename,e.job,e.dname,d.deptno from emp e left outer join dept d on e.deptno=d.deptno;

40 deptno wil not show becoz it in table 2

select e.ename,e.job,e.dname,d.deptno from emp e right outer join dept d on e.deptno=d.deptno;

non matching columnwill remain null.


select e.ename,e.job,e.dname,d.deptno from emp e full outer join dept d on e.deptno=d.deptno;

non equi join

select * from salgrade;
disp ename n sal and salary grade.

lowsal and high sal common column
select e.ename,e.sal,s.grade from emp e ,salgrade s where e.sal between s.losal and s.hisal;


select e.ename,e.job,e.deptno,d.dname,d.loc from emp e join dept d using (deptno); 

select e.ename,e.job,deptno,d.dname,d.loc from emp e join dept d using (deptno); donot give alias to common column

select e.ename,e.job,e.deptno,d.dname,d.loc from emp e natural join dept d ;


give emp name , job and manager  

self join
joining a table itself

select e1.ename employee,e2.ename mgr from emp  e1 , emp e2 where e1.mgr =e2.empno;




-------------------------------------------------------

VIEW
its as logical represantation of adta , it doesn' have phisical existence
create view v1 as select empno,ename from emp1;

simple view- derived from one table
complex view -multiple table
complex view dml operation not allowed


select rowid from emp1;
select rowid from v1;

row id is a fix hexadecimal number that is assigned to each and rvery roe of a table.
these are unique.

select * from v1;
delete from v1 where ename ='KING';

select * from emp;
it will impact base table also.

delete from emp1 where ename ='SCOTT';

select * from v1;

through view we can access the person of a table.
you can pefomr any operation in any table view or base 
both of them are impacted.


for security purpose we are using view.

create view v2 as select * from emp1 with read only;

upadte v2 set sal = 1-- where sal=5000;

we cannot perform any modifiaction in view table with read only condition.

but we can upadte on base table.


create view v3 as select * from emp1 where deptno = 20 with check option;
insert into v3(deptno) values(30);

insert into v3(deptno) values(20);


------------------------------------------

FUNCTION

block unit whichwill take more than one  argument and out put is one
number ,character, date ,group

number function take input number and output is also number.

it can replace string by string

select replace('ASISH','AS','KL') from dual;

select instr(STRING,SUBSTRING,POSITION,OCCURANCE) from dual;

select instr('this is a string','th',1,1) from dual;

it used to find the position of a string 
 
select instr('thisisthething','is',1,2) from dual;

select instr('thisisthething','is',1,1) from dual;



--------------------------------------------------------

SUBQUERY

query within a query is known as subquery.


child will be input for the parent query.

you cannot user order by in sub query 
if sub query return greater than one row then we use in operator , cannot use equal to operator.

select * from emp where hiredate =(select min(hiredate) from emp);

listout all the employee who are working under BLAKE.
select * from emp where mgr =(select empno form emp where ename='BLAKE');

this is known as single row subquery

operator used in single row sub query is equal to.

listout all the employee who are working in sales department
select * from emp where deptno=(select deptno from dept where dname='SALES')




-------------------------------------
Multiple row SUBQUERY

disp all the emp details whose sal is equal to sal of deptno 20.


select * from emp where sal =(select sal from emp where deptno=20);
it will return more than one row

select * from emp where sal in(select sal from emp where deptno=20);
 
select * from emp where sal >all (select avg(sal) from emp group by deptno)

select * from emp where sal >any (select avg(sal) from emp group by deptno)


multiple column subquery
listout emp details whose job and sal is equal to the job and sal of emp blake;

select * from emp where(job,mgr) in (select job,mgr from emp where ename='BLAKE') 


Inline views

when a subquery will start with form clause is known as inline views subquery.

select rownum from emp;

select * from emp where rownum =1;
 
 select * from emp where rownum =2;
 row num never works on greaterthan one positive integaers
 
 select * from emp where rownum <= 2;
 
 select * from emp where rownum >=2;
 it will not work,
 
 i want to see last two rows
